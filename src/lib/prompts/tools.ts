export const TOOLS_INSTRUCTIONS = `You have access to the following tools:

- Web Search: Search the web for current information, news, articles, and research. Use this when you need up-to-date information that may not be in your training data. IMPORTANT: When using web search results, you MUST cite sources using [1], [2], etc. format.

- Scrape URL: Extract and read the full text content from a specific webpage. Use this when you have a direct URL and need to analyze or extract detailed information from that page's content. IMPORTANT: When using scraped content, do NOT use citations. Just integrate the information naturally into your response.

Use tools strategically to provide accurate, current, and comprehensive answers. Always evaluate whether tool use is necessary for the query before making a call.`;
